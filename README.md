# learningphp

These files are homework for my WebScripting class that show some basic things to do with php, like connecting to MySql database in my Apache web server (XAMPP) using MySQLi library. 
Homework.php is a code that add integers stored in two variables and output the result. It also concatenate three strings and at least one of them is stored in valuable and I used the date funtion to output the word "even" if the hour of the time on the server is even, or output "odd" if it is not.
In the file AddRecords.php, I connected to my database using MySqli library and inserted the query adding values for one of the tables. Update.php shows the code to update a specific registry in the database.
The file Display.php selected some data from my database and displayed it on a web browser as a table.
There is also a word document with the screen shots showing the results of my codes.
All codes contain comments for a better understanding.
