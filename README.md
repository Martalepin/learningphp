# learningphp

It is a homework for my webscripting class that shows some basic thing to do with php connecting to MySql database using MySQLi library. 
in the file AddRecords I connect to the database using MySqli library and insert the query adding values for one of the tables in my database.
the file Displayphp select some data from my database and display it on a web browser as a table.
All codes contain comments for a better understanding.
