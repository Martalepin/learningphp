# learningphp

These files are homework for my webscripting class that shows some basic thing to do with php connecting to MySql database using MySQLi library. 
in the file AddRecords I connected to my database using MySqli library and inserted the query adding values for one of the tables.
The file Displayphp selected some data from my database and displayed it on a web browser as a table.
There is also a word document with the screen shots showing the results of my codes.
All codes contain comments for a better understanding.
